         build : Performs 'webdsl clean' and compiles the application
                  using the settings in application.ini.

           new : Creates an example WebDSL application in a subdirectory
                 of the current directory. The application name is also
                 the name of the directory.

        deploy : Deploys the application to Tomcat. Changing the settings
                 in application.ini requires a new 'webdsl build' first.

         clean : Removes the ${generate-dir} directory which contains generated files.
      
      cleanall : Removes the generated files and all the caches.

         check : Runs all tests using the database settings in application.ini.

    test [app] : Builds [app] using a generated application.ini and
                 runs all tests on a Sqlite database file.
      
test-web [app] : Builds [app] using a generated application.ini and
                 runs all UI tests on a Sqlite database file and a local Tomcat instance.
      
     run [app] : Builds [app] using a generated application.ini and
                 runs the app in a local Tomcat instance.
      
           run : Builds [app] using the database settings in application.ini and
                 runs the app in a local Tomcat instance.
      
       rebuild : Recompiles the application code, but does not check for changes in static content (e.g. images).
                 Uses the settings in application.ini.
      
 rebuilddeploy : Recompiles the application code, but does not check for changes in static content (e.g. images).
                 Uses the settings in application.ini. After the rebuild, a 'tomcatdeploy' is executed.	
      
Note: webdsl tasks can be chained in one call, for example, 'webdsl build tomcatdeploy' does a build and a deploy
