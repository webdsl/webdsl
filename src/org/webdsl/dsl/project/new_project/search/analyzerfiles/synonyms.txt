# This is a stop word file that can be used by a SynonymFilter,
# like the analyzer 'synonym' in searchconfiguration.app
#
# Be aware that any change to an analyzer in use means that you need to reindex your data.
# See http://webdsl.org/selectpage/Manual/Search for more info on re(indexing).

# FILE FORMAT:
# blank lines and lines starting with pound are comments.

#Explicit mappings match any token sequence on the LHS of "=>"
#and replace with all alternatives on the RHS.  These types of mappings
#ignore the expand parameter in the schema.
#Examples:
#i-pod, i pod => ipod,
#sea biscuit, sea biscit => seabiscuit

#Equivalent synonyms may be separated with commas and give
#no explicit mapping.  In this case the mapping behavior will
#be taken from the expand parameter in the schema.  This allows
#the same synonym file to be used in different synonym handling strategies.
#Examples:
#ipod, i-pod, i pod
#foozball , foosball
#universe , cosmos
#laptop, notebook
#computer, pc
#cpu, processor
#ram, memory
#hdd, hard drive, hard disk

# If expand==true, "ipod, i-pod, i pod" is equivalent to the explicit mapping:
#ipod, i-pod, i pod => ipod, i-pod, i pod
# If expand==false, "ipod, i-pod, i pod" is equivalent to the explicit mapping:
#ipod, i-pod, i pod => ipod

#multiple synonym mapping entries are merged.
#foo => foo bar
#foo => baz
#is equivalent to
#foo => foo bar, baz
